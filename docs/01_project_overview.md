# Project Overview: AXIS Performance Care

## The Concept
We are building a high-fidelity landing page for "AXIS Performance Care," a concierge mobile chiropractic service in Bountiful, Utah. 

## The Brand Identity
AXIS is not a standard medical clinic. It is positioned as an exclusive "Performance Club." 
- **Vibe:** "The Black Card of Healthcare." SWAT Team meets Ritz-Carlton.
- **Target Audience:** High-performing executives, business owners, and athletes who value time and privacy.
- **Core Value Prop:** "We optimize your physiology in your environment. No waiting rooms. No friction."

## The User Journey (5 Horizontal Strips)
1. **The Hero:** High-impact hook. "High-Performance Recovery. Delivered."
2. **The Friction vs. Flow:** A comparison section. Old Way (Traffic/Waiting) vs. Axis Way (We come to you).
3. **The Workflow:** Visualizing the 3-step process (Request -> Deploy -> Perform).
4. **The Membership:** showcasing the "Club" perks (Bat Phone, Sterile Field).
5. **The Footer:** SEO-rich location data for Bountiful/Davis County.
