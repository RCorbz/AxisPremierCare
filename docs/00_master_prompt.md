# Master Prompt for Project IDX

I have provided context files in the `docs/` folder regarding the branding, design system, and content for "AXIS Performance Care."

**Your Task:**
Scaffold a modern, responsive React landing page using Tailwind CSS.

**Execution Steps:**
1. Read `02_design_system.md` to understand the color palette (Matte Black #121212, Electric Volt #CCFF00).
2. Read `05_reference_code.md`. Use this code as your foundational structure.
3. **CRITICAL:** The reference code is missing "Section 2: Friction vs. Flow" described in `03_content_copy.md`. You must inject this new section between the Hero and the Workflow section.
4. Ensure all text matches `03_content_copy.md`.
5. Use `lucide-react` for icons.

**Guardrails (CRITICAL):**
- **NO BEDROOM:** The environment must be clinical, professional, and elite. Avoid any imagery or layout that suggests a home bedroom setting.
- **NO INSURANCE:** This is a cash-pay, premium service. Do not include insurance logos, "insurance accepted" badges, or typical medical insurance language.
